# NLU

This project is an experimentation on Natural Language Understanding

* [x] design models for intents and intent utterances
* [x] build a database for the intents dataset
* [x] build endpoints for serving js and css directly from the folder
* [x] test adding members for the sql database
* [x] put layout.html on the final design - side menu
* [x] build all the Intents add flow
  * [x] create add intent button
  * [x] create script to add intent on database. dont add existent intents
  * [x] create script for updating the list of intents and reformulate the intents html page
  * [x] create delete intent button
  * [x] create script to del intent on database
  * [x] cancel button whilee at the add intent modal window
* [x] build all the flow of adding utterances for intents
* [x] build extract for json/LUIS like
* [0] prepare ipython notebook for NLU
* [ ] build first extractor
* [ ] build extract for text/classifier-like
* [ ] think about app configs
  * [ ] separate flask endpoints and configs
  * [ ] model configs
* [ ] think about ipynb + folder distribution
* [ ] build a ipynb extractor
* [ ] draw the solution
  * [ ] with all the modules for inference
  * [ ] with all the modules plus an anomaly detector for inference and active learning
  * [ ] the full solution and work of a modeller and applications
    * [ ] depict the developer operations side
    * [ ] depict various developers (modeler, app builder, feature engineer, etc...) 
* [ ] rebuild server endpoints
  * [ ] home
  * [ ] intents
  * [ ] utterances
  * [ ] extract/import configs
  * [ ] model/train
  * [ ] model/config
